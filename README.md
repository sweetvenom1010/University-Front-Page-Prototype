# University-Front-Page-Prototype


This is an attractive implementation of a Front Page of GLA University to display how Data can  be beautifully presented on the Website.

## Installation

Have any good browser to run the ```index.html``` file

## Usage

Some redirects are from my project 
[University Prototype](https://github.com/sweetvenom1010/University-Prototype).
So you may want to look into that repository to get those files if you wish for redirects to work.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
I would love to take this to next level and make an amazing selling UI for Colleges or Schools after building Back-End.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
